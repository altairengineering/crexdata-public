#### YAP Installation Instructions

[YAP 6.3](https://github.com/vscosta/yap-6.3) is the latest stable version of YAP; installation and execution instructions may be found in this [manual](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~vsc/yap/index.html).

In case the installation of YAP fails (we have noticed this in Ubuntu 20 LTS), please download YAP 6.3 from the "threads" branch of the [repository]((https://github.com/vscosta/yap-6.3)). To do this from the command line, please type:

``` git clone -b threads https://github.com/vscosta/yap-6.3 yap ```

where ```-b threads``` specifies that YAP will be downloaded from the "threads" branch.

## Execution in Prolog

### Requirements

To execute RTEC, you need, at the very least: 

- [SWI-Prolog 8.2+](https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable) or [YAP 6.3](yap_installation.md).

Optionally, you may install [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) for generating the dependency graph of an RTEC program.

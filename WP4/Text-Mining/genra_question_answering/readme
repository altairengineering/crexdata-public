To run the QA model you can execute:
- python3 run.py --topic innsbruck --batch_size 150 --llm solar --aggregator linear --topk 3


run.py expects two csv files:
	1. The list of queries to search for answers (queries.csv, rename the provided sample or create these file)
	2. The list of tweets (tweets.csv, rename the provided sample or create these file)


The output of the QA includes:
	1. Each query together with its topk relevant tweets (genra_answers__.csv)
	2. The final summary based on the retrieved answers (genra_final_summary_.txt) 


Requirements:

- PyFLAGR for rank aggregation
- haystack for indexing 
- sentence_transformers for text embeddings
- transformers for LLMs



QA has been tested with the following LLMs:
- solar (better results)
- mistral
